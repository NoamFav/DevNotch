> [!NOTE]
> **DevNotch is an independent fork of [Boring Notch](https://github.com/TheBoredTeam/boring.notch)**, the original project by The Bored Team. All credit for the core app goes to the upstream authors — this fork adds personal tweaks (an AeroSpace workspace indicator, extra HUD widgets) on top of their work. If you're looking for the upstream project, its Discord and Ko-fi are linked above.

Say hello to **DevNotch**, the coolest way to make your MacBook's notch the star of the show! Say goodbye to boring status bars: with DevNotch, your notch transforms into a dynamic music control center, complete with a vibrant visualizer and all the essential music controls you need. But that's just the start! DevNotch also offers calendar integration, a handy file shelf with AirDrop support, a complete MacOS HUD replacement and more!

## Installation

**System Requirements:**
- macOS **14 Sonoma** or later
- Apple Silicon or Intel Mac

---

### Option 1: Download and Install Manually

<a href="https://github.com/NoamFav/DevNotch/releases/latest" target="_self"><img width="200" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3179be1-8416-4b8a-b417-743e1ecc67d6" alt="Download for macOS" /></a>

Once downloaded, open the `.dmg` and move **DevNotch** to your `/Applications` folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There's no Apple Developer account behind this fork, so macOS will warn you that DevNotch is from an unidentified developer on first launch. This is expected behavior.
>
> You'll need to bypass this before the app will open. You only need to do this once. Use one of the methods below.

---

#### Recommended: Terminal (Always Works)

This is the quickest and easiest method. It only requires a single command and works consistently for all users. System Settings can sometimes fail and won't work for non-admin users.

After moving DevNotch to your Applications folder, run:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/devNotch.app
```

Then open the app normally.

---

#### Alternative: System Settings

> [!NOTE]
> This method doesn't work for all users. If this doesn't work, use the Terminal method above.

1. Try to open the app — you'll see a security warning.
2. Click **OK** to dismiss it.
3. Open **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security**.
4. Scroll to the bottom and click **Open Anyway** next to the DevNotch warning.
5. Confirm if prompted.

---

### Option 2: Build from Source

This fork doesn't have a Homebrew cask of its own — see [Building from Source](#building-from-source) below.

## Usage

- Launch the app, and voilà—your notch is now the coolest part of your screen.
- Hover over the notch to see it expand and reveal all its secrets.
- Use the controls to manage your music like a rockstar.
- Click the star in your menu bar to customize your notch to your heart's content.

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a personal fork, mostly maintained for my own use — but issues and PRs are still welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). For anything about the core app itself, consider contributing upstream to [Boring Notch](https://github.com/TheBoredTeam/boring.notch) instead.
